"Make the Liver Great Again" is one fancy name given to the COHORT Analysis on the SHIP data.<br />This is a 2-member team of Subhashree Mangaraj (Matriculation number: ) and Anirban Saha (Matriculation number: 220835)<br />


###**Overview and Motivation. **<br />

The SHIP data set was provided to us by the supervisor, Mr. Uli Niemann. Previously, Uli has worked on this dataset with Mr. H. Volzke, Mr. Jens-Peter Kuhn, Prof. M. Spiliopoulou. <br />
The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) dataset has data of over four thousand residents of Pomerania in Germany, in the age group 20 - 79. Data were collected in three phases: <br />
* Phase 1 [1997-2001] with 4308 participants.<br /> 
* Phase 2 [2002-2006] with 3300 participants.<br />
* Phase 3 [2008-2012] with 2333 participants.<br />
It has 4308 rows and 400 columns; the target variable being liver fat. It has 578 labelled data. <br />
Weâ€™ve used this dataset to explore various functionalities of R and R packages, learning the different phases of data science in detail and acquiring skills of handling data, modelling and visualising it using the R programming language. 

<br />
<br />
In the next section "Exploratory Data Analysis", we would learn more about the data and in the sextion next, "Models", we would implement the models and proceed with the analysis in the final section.
